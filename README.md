## 🛰 Enterprise Project Experience  
### Qualcomm – AWARE (IoT Device Management System)

Worked on an **enterprise-level Qualcomm AWARE platform** designed to manage and monitor **multiple intelligent device types** through web-based dashboards.

This platform handled **real-time device data, lifecycle management, and user-driven customization** across different applications.

### Device Types & Functionality:
- **Trackers**  
  Used for tracking parcels or assets moving from one location to another, providing **real-time location and sensor data** displayed on the UI.
  
- **Thin Trackers**  
  Supported **tilt sensing**, showing how much a package or object was tilted during transit.
  
- **Labels**  
  Detected events such as **box opening, light detection, or drop events**, and reported these events to the system.

Each device type had **distinct behavior, data structure, and UI representation**, all handled conditionally on the frontend.

---

### Key Contributions:
- Implemented **conditional UI rendering** to display different device types, sensors, and data based on device configuration and state.
- Worked on **device lifecycle management**, including handling **pre-generated devices** and creating **custom device types** based on user requirements.
- Enabled **custom device creation**, allowing users to define what sensors and capabilities a device should include.
- Integrated **WebSocket-based real-time updates** to show live device data, alerts, and error states on dashboards.
- Developed and maintained both **Admin Dashboard** and **User Dashboard**, each with role-specific access and features.
- Contributed to a **common shared repository** used across multiple applications to ensure consistency and reusability.
- Collaborated with backend and system teams to align UI behavior with real-world device events and business logic.

### Applications Involved:
- **Admin Dashboard** – Device management, configuration, and monitoring
